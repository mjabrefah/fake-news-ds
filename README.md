# fake-news-ds
This is my first real-world data science project.

Fake news encapsulates pieces of news that may be hoaxes and is genereally spread via social media.

Such news items may contain false and/or exaggerated claims, and may end up being viralized by algorithms and users may end up in a filter bubble.

This model goes through a set of labeled news items and detects their accuracy.
