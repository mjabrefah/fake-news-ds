# fake-news-ds
This is my first real-world data science project.

Fake news encapsulates pieces of news that may be hoaxes and is generally  spread via social and online media.
Such news items may contain false and/or exaggerated claims, and may end up being viralized by algorithms and
users may end up in a filter bubble.

This project takes a set of news labeled as fake and real and predicts its accuracy
